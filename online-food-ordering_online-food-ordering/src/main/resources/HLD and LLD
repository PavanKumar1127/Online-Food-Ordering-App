•	Restaurant Management: Restaurant owners manage their restaurant details and menus through a dedicated dashboard.
•	Order Processing: Users place orders, which are processed by the backend, notifying the restaurant and delivery partners.
•	Delivery Tracking: Delivery partners update the status of the order, which is visible to the user in real-time.
•	Payment Integration: Users can choose to pay online or opt for cash on delivery.
5. Security and Compliance
•	Data Encryption: Use SSL/TLS for data in transit, and encrypt sensitive data in the database.
•	Role-Based Access Control: Different access levels for Users, Restaurant Owners, Admins, and Delivery Partners.
•	Compliance: Ensure compliance with local regulations, such as GDPR for data protection.

4. Detailed Workflows
4.1. User Registration and Authentication Workflow:
1.	Registration: User submits registration form -> Backend validates data -> Create new user in database -> Send confirmation email.
2.	Login: User submits login credentials -> Backend verifies credentials -> Generate and return JWT token.
4.2. Restaurant Management Workflow:
1.	Restaurant Registration: Restaurant owner submits registration form -> Backend validates data -> Create new restaurant record -> Notify admin for approval.
2.	Menu Management: Owner adds/updates food items -> Backend updates database -> Update search indices.
4.3. Order Placement and Tracking Workflow:
1.	Order Placement: User selects food items -> Adds to cart -> Proceeds to checkout -> Backend creates order record -> Notify restaurant and delivery partner.
2.	Order Tracking: Delivery partner updates order status -> User receives real-time updates -> Order delivered.
4.4. Cart Management Workflow:
1.	Add to Cart: User selects food item -> Adds to cart -> Backend updates cart record.
2.	Remove from Cart: User removes item -> Backend updates cart record.
4.5. Search and Discovery Workflow:
1.	Search: User enters search query -> Backend queries database -> Returns filtered and sorted results.
2.	Recommendations: Based on user preferences -> Backend suggests restaurants and dishes.
























The design outlined above captures many core features similar to what is found in Zomato, including user management, restaurant management, order management, and various other entities such as food items, orders, and carts. However, to further align with Zomato's functionalities and improve scalability and maintainability, we can consider additional features and enhancements, as well as a shift to a microservices architecture.
Enhancements to Resemble Zomato
1.	Reviews and Ratings:
o	Allow users to review and rate restaurants and food items. This can influence search results and recommendations.
o	Entities:
	Review: Stores user reviews for restaurants and food items.
	Rating: Stores user ratings for restaurants and food items.
2.	Search and Filtering:
o	Advanced search functionality, including filtering by cuisine, rating, price, location, etc.
o	Entities:
	SearchIndex: To optimize search performance, maintaining an index of searchable fields.
3.	Promotions and Discounts:
o	Support for promotional offers and discount codes.
o	Entities:
	Promotion: Details of promotional offers.
4.	Delivery Tracking:
o	Real-time tracking of delivery partners.
o	Entities:
	DeliveryPartner: Details of delivery partners, including real-time location.
5.	User Preferences and Recommendations:
o	Personalized recommendations based on user preferences and past orders.
o	Entities:
	UserPreferences: Stores preferences and past orders to tailor recommendations.
6.	Payment Integration:
o	Integration with multiple payment gateways for a seamless payment experience.
o	Entities:
	Payment: Details of payment transactions.
Microservices Architecture
In a microservices architecture, the application is divided into smaller, independently deployable services, each responsible for specific business capabilities. This allows for better scalability, maintainability, and fault isolation.
Microservices Breakdown:
1.	User Service:
o	Handles user registration, authentication, profile management, and roles.
o	APIs:
	/register, /login, /profile, /roles
2.	Restaurant Service:
o	Manages restaurant registration, menu management, and restaurant details.
o	APIs:
	/registerRestaurant, /updateRestaurant, /getRestaurantDetails
3.	Order Service:
o	Manages order placement, tracking, and status updates.
o	APIs:
	/placeOrder, /trackOrder, /updateOrderStatus
4.	Food Service:
o	Manages food items, categories, and availability.
o	APIs:
	/addFoodItem, /updateFoodItem, /getFoodDetails
5.	Review and Rating Service:
o	Handles user reviews and ratings for restaurants and food items.
o	APIs:
	/addReview, /getReviews, /addRating, /getRatings
6.	Cart Service:
o	Manages user carts, including adding/removing items and calculating totals.
o	APIs:
	/addToCart, /removeFromCart, /getCartDetails
7.	Payment Service:
o	Manages payment processing, including integration with payment gateways.
o	APIs:
	/processPayment, /getPaymentStatus
8.	Search and Recommendation Service:
o	Manages search functionality, filtering, and personalized recommendations.
o	APIs:
	/search, /getRecommendations
9.	Delivery Service:
o	Manages delivery partner assignments, tracking, and delivery updates.
o	APIs:
	/assignDeliveryPartner, /trackDelivery
10.	Notification Service:
o	Manages notifications to users and partners via email, SMS, or in-app notifications.
o	APIs:
	/sendNotification
Communication Between Microservices
**1. API Gateway:
•	Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate services.
•	Handles tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and request aggregation.
2.	Service Discovery:
o	Automatically detects and tracks available microservices, their instances, and endpoints.
o	Tools like Eureka, Consul, or Kubernetes service discovery can be used.
3.	Inter-Service Communication:
o	Synchronous: REST or gRPC for real-time communication.
o	Asynchronous: Message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka for events and notifications.
4.	Database Design:
o	Each microservice can have its own database or schema to ensure data isolation and service independence.
o	Use a shared data store only when necessary, such as for user authentication.
5.	Security:
o	Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure access management.
o	Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication across services.
6.	Monitoring and Logging:
o	Implement centralized logging and monitoring using tools like ELK Stack, Prometheus, or Grafana.
o	Ensure that each microservice provides health checks and metrics.
Example Workflow: Order Placement	
1.	User places an order via the Order Service.
2.	Order Service validates the order, calculates totals, and sends the order details to the Payment Service.
3.	Payment Service processes the payment and updates the order status.
4.	Order Service notifies the Delivery Service to assign a delivery partner.
5.	Delivery Service tracks the delivery and provides real-time updates.
6.	Notification Service sends order confirmation and delivery updates to the user.
This microservices architecture allows each component to scale independently, be deployed separately, and ensures that a failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system. Additionally, it aligns well with modern DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native deployments.
